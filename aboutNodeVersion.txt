The error you're seeing is because the version of Node.js installed on your system (22.15.0) is not compatible with the grocery-admin project. The project requires Node.js in the range: >=18.0.0 <=20.x.x

✅ Solution Options:
Option 1: Switch Node.js Version Using nvm (Recommended)
If you don’t already have Node Version Manager (nvm) for Windows, install it first.

Check available versions:

powershell
nvm list available
Install a compatible version (e.g., 20.12.2):

powershell
nvm install 20.12.2

powershell
nvm use 20.12.2

powershell
node -v

To see all Node.js versions you've installed using NVM on Windows, just run:
nvm list

powershell
yarn install
